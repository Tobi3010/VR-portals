How to Run and Play:
Our '.apk' file is located in the folder, 'vr-enjoyers/Build', and is called 'nature_a2_scene.apk'.

Our minigame is to throw objects into the basket, once one object is thrown in, it will toggle to "hard mode"
by moving alittle. When another object is thrown in, it will toggle to "easy" mode, by pulsing and becoming big, making it easier to hit. Then when a third object is thrown in, it will go back to normal.
