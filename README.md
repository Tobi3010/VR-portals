## About This Project


## How To Run & Play
- FILE :: Our '.apk' file is located in the folder, 'vr-enjoyers/Build', and is called 'PortalScene.apk'.
- CONTROLS :: The left and right controllers can be used to walk.
- Note: Free teleportation and other locomotion techniques have been intentionally disabled. This is to ensure that the player is limited to controlled movement and can focus solely on the portal travel mechanic.
- OBJECTIVE :: The player should explore six distinctive environments: Start Area, Forest, City, Dungeon, Ocean, & Battlefield. The player's objective is to progress through all six environments. After reaching the last environment, the player will find a portal that returns them to the Start Area.
- GOAL :: The player must go through the entire game course four times; each cycle introduces a new design from the four portal designs implemented in our game. Upon completion of the fourth cycle, when the player returns to the Start Area, no portal will appear. This signals the end of the experience as there is no way out of the Start Area.
